Sample Overview

This training kit is a set of resources for extending the Honeycomb Rush Lab to better understand and experiment with games in different platforms by using XNA Game Studio 4.0. This lab shows you how simple it is to port a Windows Phone 7 game to both Xbox 360 and Windows, while retaining the original game’s feel and functionality.
