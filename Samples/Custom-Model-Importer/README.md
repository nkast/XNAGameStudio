Description:

This sample shows how to implement a custom model importer for the XNA Framework Content Pipeline.

Sample Overview

The sample importer is for the popular 3D model format OBJ. It can import many simple .obj files and their accompanying material (.mtl) files. However, the sample doesn't fully support all possible OBJ models.

Any project that references the importer can use the importer. The importer can be selected automatically by file extension, or manually through the Properties pane. For more information, see the topic Using a Custom Importer or Content Processor in the documentation.
