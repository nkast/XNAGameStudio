Description:

This sample shows how to read the accelerometer sensor on Windows Phone 7.

Sample Overview

Windows Phone 7 devices include a number of hardware sensors, one of which is the accelerometer. The accelerometer can be used to detect tilt, shaking, and other motion in three dimensions. This sample illustrates use of an accelerometer class to handle accelerometer data and to update the position of a sprite on the screen.
