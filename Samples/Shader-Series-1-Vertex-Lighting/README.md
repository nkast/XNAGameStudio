Description:

This sample shows one of the most basic uses of shader effects — vertex lighting.

Sample Overview

This sample explores the diffuse and ambient lighting models and combines them into a simple first-step shader. Additionally, basic XNA Framework Effect code is explored to show how the C# source code interacts with the effect files.
