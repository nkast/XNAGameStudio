Description:

Minjie is a complete XNA Game Studio game. The project comes ready to compile and run. It is easy to customize with a little bit of C# programming. You are free to use the source code as the basis for your own game projects, and to share your work with others.

The goal in Minjie is to flip your opponent's pieces to your own color by surrounding them on two sides with your own pieces. For example, you can surround a line of pieces by first placing your piece on one end of the line. Then, on your next turn, place another piece at the other end of the line. All of the opponent's pieces that you surround will then flip over to your color. The play alternates with each player placing a piece at a location that causes a flip. The game ends when there are no more moves available for either player. The winner is the player with the most pieces on the board when the game ends. Minjie supports one player playing against the AI or two players playing against each other.
