This program enables the user to enter a word or phrase in one language, and have it translated into another language. The starter kit demonstrates how to call a web service, use an XNA Framework API from within a Silverlight application to play a sound, maintain a history list in isolated storage, and animate an image in a ToggleButton.

You can also view the documentation for this Starter Kit in the MSDN Libary. View the documentation for this Starter Kit.
