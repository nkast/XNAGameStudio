Description:

This sample explains how to move lighting calculations to the pixel shader for high-quality per-pixel lighting.

Sample Overview

This sample uses Phong reflection to approximate specular light, creating highlights on the object. Specular highlights are light that's reflected directly to a viewer. These highlights can be simulated through a number of techniques.
