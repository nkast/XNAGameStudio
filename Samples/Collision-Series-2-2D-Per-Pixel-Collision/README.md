Description:

This tutorial details how to perform per-pixel collision detection in two dimensions. This tutorial builds on the previous tutorial in this series, Collision Series 1: 2D Rectangle Collision. Follow the steps in that tutorial before starting this tutorial.

Tutorial Overview

In the previous example, you created a simple object avoidance game by using rectangle collision detection. The rectangles used were only an approximation of the blocks and person drawn into the textures. You may have noticed that the exclusive use of rectangles resulted in imprecise behavior for nonrectangular objects.
