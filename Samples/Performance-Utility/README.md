Utility Overview

This utility consists of three tools that you can add to your XNA Game Studio projects for performance tuning and debugging: a profiler that can measure the time taken across any code path you designate, a frames-per-second counter, and a customizable on-screen debug console that you can use to monitor and modify your game's behavior at runtime.

Note: This utility doesn't currently include supporting documentation. To see an additional example of how this utility is used, see the Performance Measuring Sample.
