Description:

This sample demonstrates how to create a simple chase camera with spring physics.

Sample Overview

In this sample, you pilot a spaceship from a third-person chase camera view. The motion of both the ship and the camera are governed by simple physics. When the ship speeds away, the camera pulls back. When the ship turns, the camera lags behind in the turn to show a partial profile view of the ship. When the ship stops moving, the camera gradually slides back into place.

By pressing a button, you can compare and contrast the spring-based camera with a rigid, fixed-offset camera. You'll notice that the spring-based camera provides a greater sense of speed, and the ship feels more natural to control.
