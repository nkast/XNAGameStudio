Sample Overview

Games frequently need to add visual debugging information to help identify bugs or to verify that certain parts of the code are working correctly. This visual debugging is used to show bounding volumes, as well as other primitive shapes such as lines and triangles. The Shape Rendering Sample provides a DebugShapeRenderer that allows games to easily render debugging shapes.
