# XNAGameStudio

The Education library from XNA Game Studios, valuable for MonoGame Developers for advanced samples.

# Getting Started

The project contains all the XNA samples from the XNA Creators Club site, however they are still currently in XNA Game format, meaning by default they can only be opened on machines running Visual Studio 2010 with the XNA Game Studio development MSI's installed

The plan is to upgrade / migrate each sample to source in a MonoGame project.  Along with gathering all the necessary XNA documentation to support them.

# Using the Samples with MG in Visual Studio 2017 / 2019

You need to install the latest [MG SDK](https://github.com/nkast/XNAGameStudio/tree/master/MG%20SDK/) to build those samples.

# Using XNA projects in Visual Studio 2013 / 2015

Help is at hand for more modern visual studio versions by using the awesome MXA Game Studio visual studio addon.

in the project you will find downloads for:

* [Visual Studio 2015 addon](http://mxa.codeplex.com/releases/view/618279)
* [Visual Studio 2013 addon](http://mxa.codeplex.com/releases/view/117230)
* [Visual Studio 2012 addon](http://mxa.codeplex.com/releases/view/117564)

These effectively install XNA game studio with a modified project template definition that works with modern visual studio.
As well as installing all the necessary dependencies and required components for XNA projects to work.

You can still build and run the projects on Windows, however deploying to Xbox and Phone doesn't work anymore. But you can still open those projects successfully.

# Now get going

Over time the archive will be made MonoGame ready (maybe even some other XNA based frameworks as well, who knows). So be patient or even get involved.
